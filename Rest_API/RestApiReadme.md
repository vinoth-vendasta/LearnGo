## Route Handling

## Gin Gonic `(github.com/gin-gonic/gin)`

**Gin** is a high-performance HTTP web framework written in Go. It's known for its speed and efficiency, making it a popular choice for building REST APIs and microservices. It achieves its performance through intelligent routing and a minimal, but powerful, feature set.

**Other Popular Route Handling Packages in Go:**
**Gin:** Excellent all-rounder. High performance, good features, widely adopted, great for REST APIs. A very common and safe choice.
**Echo:** Very similar to Gin, often a matter of taste. Also high performance and feature-rich.
**Fiber:** If you need extreme performance and are comfortable with a different underlying HTTP engine (Fasthttp).
**Gorilla Mux:** If you prefer a more modular approach to building your web stack, focusing solely on advanced routing and choosing other components yourself.
**net/http:** For the simplest cases, or when you want to learn the fundamentals of web in Go without abstractions.

### Live Reloading?
Live reloading (sometimes called "hot reloading" in other contexts, though Go's implementation is usually a full restart) refers to the capability of your development server to automatically detect changes in your source code, recompile the application, and restart the server without you having to manually intervene.
